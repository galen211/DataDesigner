# Fern Docs

This folder is the Fern Docs build for NeMo Data Designer. The site currently deploys to **`datadesigner.docs.buildwithfern.com/nemo/datadesigner`**; [`docs.yml`](docs.yml) also declares the future `docs.nvidia.com/nemo/datadesigner` custom domain.

## Migration phase

Data Designer is moving from MkDocs to Fern over several releases. During that transition:

- Keep the MkDocs build and release archive working.
- Keep Fern working in parallel for local checks and hosted validation.
- Treat `docs/` as the docs source of truth unless a page has already been intentionally moved to Fern-only MDX.
- Treat `docs/notebook_source/*.py` as the notebook source of truth.
- Keep generated Fern API reference and notebook artifacts gitignored.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Fern CLI globally
npm install -g fern-api
```

## First-time setup

Two pre-render steps are needed before the dev server has all content. Both produce gitignored files and are safe to rerun.

### 1. Python API reference (gitignored - must regenerate)

`make generate-fern-api-reference` uses `py2fern` to extract API docs from local Python source. The output lands in `fern/code-reference/` (gitignored), preserving the existing Config API folder and adding Interface and curated Engine extension API folders.

```bash
make generate-fern-api-reference
```

`py2fern` only descends into Python packages. Add `__init__.py` to any new subdirectory whose modules should appear in the API reference.

The `libraries:` block in [`docs.yml`](docs.yml) still documents the Fern-native config generator. Run `make generate-fern-api-reference-native` only when you want the Fern CLI output and have Fern auth.

Re-run when the upstream package source changes.

### 2. Notebook tutorials (gitignored - regenerate on clone)

Each tutorial source file is converted to a JSON+TS pair in `fern/components/notebooks/`, then rendered through the `<NotebookViewer>` component on the wrapper MDX page. Output is gitignored; regenerate it after cloning and after changing `docs/notebook_source/*.py`.

```bash
make generate-fern-notebooks                 # convert docs/notebook_source/*.py, preferring docs/notebooks/*.ipynb when present
make generate-fern-notebooks-with-outputs    # full pipeline: execute → colabify → convert (needs NVIDIA_API_KEY)
```

The docs build does not use `docs/colab_notebooks/`; those files exist for the wrapper pages' `colabUrl` links. The converter (`fern/scripts/ipynb-to-fern-json.py`) still strips Colab-only setup cells defensively if run on a Colab notebook.

Fern does not run this conversion automatically. Run `make prepare-fern-docs` before local preview/checks, and run the same notebook conversion in CI before `fern generate --docs`.

## Local preview

```bash
make serve-fern-docs-locally
# → http://localhost:3000
```

`serve-fern-docs-locally` generates Fern API reference and notebook artifacts before starting `fern docs dev`. It does not publish.

## CI and publishing

Fern publishing runs alongside MkDocs during migration:

- `.github/workflows/build-fern-docs.yml` runs on release publication or manual dispatch. It snapshots release docs into the CI-managed `docs-website` branch, builds executed notebooks from the release source, runs `make check-fern-docs` from `docs-website`, and publishes Fern.
- `.github/workflows/publish-fern-devnotes.yml` runs on `main` when Dev Notes or Fern Dev Notes assets change, plus manual dispatch. It patches only Dev Notes into the `docs-website` branch's current latest docs, reuses the last docs notebook artifact, runs `make check-fern-docs`, and publishes Fern.
- `.github/workflows/docs-preview.yml` remains the PR preview workflow and posts both MkDocs and Fern preview links for same-repository PRs. It converts tutorial sources without execution outputs for preview builds. Fork PRs still run docs build/checks, but skip hosted previews because those require deployment secrets.

These workflows require the org-level `DOCS_FERN_TOKEN` secret. The workflows expose it to the Fern CLI as `FERN_TOKEN`.

Fern release snapshots live on `docs-website`, not on `main`. This mirrors the MkDocs `gh-pages` model without mixing Fern source state into the MkDocs output branch. The branch stores a source snapshot, not only `fern/`, because `make check-fern-docs` needs the Python packages and workspace metadata. Pushes to `docs-website` use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so publishing happens inline in the same workflow instead of relying on a second workflow trigger.

The `docs-website` branch is an orphan-style publish branch. Published commits include `fern/publish-metadata.json` with the source repository, ref, SHA, release tag when applicable, and published branch.

The `docs-website` branch must already contain the historical Fern archive (`v0.6.0`, `v0.5.9`, `v0.5.8`, and `older`) before release publishing runs. The workflow fails if those redirect targets are missing.

Manual dispatch with `release_tag` creates or refreshes that release snapshot. For the already-published `v0.6.0` release, run **Build Fern docs** with `release_tag=v0.6.0` and `source_ref=main` after this fix merges. Future release events default `source_ref` to the release tag.

## Versioning

`main` contains only the latest Fern authoring docs. Published release snapshots live on `docs-website`.

```
fern/versions/
├── latest.yml          ← authoring nav
└── latest/pages/...    ← authoring pages
```

The CI-managed `docs-website` branch has the published archive:

```
fern/versions/
├── latest.yml
├── latest/pages/...
├── v0.6.0.yml
├── v0.6.0/pages/...
├── v0.5.9.yml
├── v0.5.9/pages/...
├── v0.5.8.yml
├── v0.5.8/pages/...
├── older.yml
└── older/pages/...
```

Each frozen `vX.Y.Z.yml` nav on `docs-website` must point only at that version's own `vX.Y.Z/pages/...` files. The release sync materializes shared historical pages into each version folder before publishing.

Normal GitHub releases do not need a dedicated pre-release Fern PR. The release workflow snapshots the release into `docs-website` and publishes from that branch.

Dev Notes publishing mirrors MkDocs: it patches only the Dev Notes nav and pages from `main` into the current latest docs on `docs-website`, then republishes Fern.

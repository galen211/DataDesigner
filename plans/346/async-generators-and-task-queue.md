# Plan: Async Generators & Task Queue Builder

Created: 2026-02-20
Status: In Progress

Historical note: this plan records the async-engine rollout before #766. References to `allow_resize` below describe removed pre-#766 behavior and are not current guidance.

## Goal

Transform the dataset builder from sequential column-by-column processing into an
async task queue with dependency-aware scheduling. Generators become async-first,
and the builder dispatches individual cell/batch tasks as soon as their upstream
dependencies are satisfied — enabling pipeline parallelism across columns and rows.

### Current architecture

```
for batch in batches (of buffer_size):       # sequential
    for column in columns:                   # sequential
        if from_scratch: generate_from_scratch(batch)
        elif cell_by_cell: fan_out(cells)    # parallel within column
        elif full_column: generate(df)
    checkpoint(batch)
```

Columns execute sequentially even when they have no mutual dependency. Rows in
different batches never overlap. Only cell-level fan-out within a single column
is parallelised.

### Target architecture

```
all tasks across all row groups submitted to a single async scheduler
scheduler dispatches tasks as dependencies are met, bounded by semaphore
row groups checkpointed to parquet when fully complete
```

Multiple columns can execute in parallel when they don't depend on each other.
Rows from different row groups can pipeline (row group 1 column B starts while
row group 0 column C is still running).

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Column-level static execution graph

- At setup: build an `ExecutionGraph` (column-level DAG) from each column's
  `config.required_columns` property (already available on all config types via
  Jinja2 template introspection) and the generation strategy from each generator.
- The graph also registers **side-effect output columns** (e.g.,
  `__trace`, `__reasoning_content`) and maps them back to their producer generator.
  A downstream column referencing `summary__trace` resolves to a dependency on
  the `summary` generator. This ensures side-effect columns are never missing from
  the graph or treated as unsatisfied.
- At runtime: a **completion tracker** (columns × rows matrix) determines which
  tasks are ready by checking whether all upstream columns for a given row are done.

The graph is column-granularity only — no cell-level nodes — so it stays small
(O(C) nodes, O(C²) edges worst-case) regardless of row count. Scheduling remains dynamic: the
completion tracker drives readiness checks as tasks complete, with no upfront
planning of execution order. The static graph adds inspectability (visualization,
critical path, upfront task counts, error attribution) without changing how the
scheduler operates at runtime.

### 2. Task granularity

| Generator type | Task unit | Readiness condition |
|---|---|---|
| `FromScratch` (seed, sampler) | `(column, row_group)` | No dependencies (always first) |
| `CELL_BY_CELL` (LLM text/code/structured/judge, image, embedding, custom) | `(column, row)` | All `required_columns` complete for that row |
| `FULL_COLUMN` (expression, validation, sampler-as-transform) | `(column, row_group)` | All `required_columns` complete for ALL rows in row group |

**Multi-column generators**: `MultiColumnConfig` (e.g., a seed dataset producing
`first_name`, `last_name`, `email`) maps multiple output columns to the same
generator instance. The graph has individual nodes for each output column. The
scheduler deduplicates by generator identity — it dispatches one task per unique
instance and marks all output columns complete on completion. This mapping
(`instance_id → output columns`) is built at scheduler init from the generator map,
where multiple column keys point to the same object.

### 3. Row groups as checkpoint units

Rows are partitioned into groups of `buffer_size` (same as current batches).
When all tasks for a row group are complete, write to parquet and free memory.
This preserves the current checkpoint/memory semantics.

Row groups may complete **out of order** (e.g., row group 2 finishes before row
group 1 if RG1 has a slow column). Checkpoint writes use the row group index for
file naming (`batch_0.parquet`, `batch_1.parquet`, etc.), so out-of-order writes
produce correctly named files. When loading the final dataset, files are read in
index order, so row ordering is preserved regardless of write order.

Full-column generators operate on their entire row group at once, same as today.

### 4. Concurrency control

Three independent layers:

1. **Execution semaphore** — bounds active compute/writeback sections to limit
   CPU/memory pressure (e.g., configurable cap, default ~128). This is **not**
   the source of truth for API concurrency.

2. **Throttle manager** (from PR #344) — gates outbound LLM calls, keyed by
   `provider+model(+domain)`. Dynamically adjusts per-key limits on 429s via AIMD.
   This is the real API concurrency control.
   **Note**: PR #344 may land after the initial scheduler PRs. When no throttle
   manager is available, LLM tasks skip the throttle acquire step and only the
   execution semaphore + submission budget bound concurrency.

3. **Submission budget** — a hard cap on "submitted but not finished" tasks
   (running + waiting on throttle/backoff), e.g., `async_scheduler_max_submitted_tasks`.

LLM tasks must **not hold execution slots while waiting on throttle/backoff**.
Dispatch pattern:
1. acquire execution slot — prepare request
2. release execution slot
3. await throttle permit (LLM tasks only; skipped without PR #344)
4. reacquire execution slot — execute generator call + writeback
5. release execution slot

Task admission is bounded by the submission budget, while active compute/writeback
is bounded by the execution semaphore. This prevents a throttled key from starving
unrelated work while still keeping total active work bounded.

### 5. Generator statefulness and reentrancy

Statefulness and sync/async are orthogonal concerns. Sync vs async is about the
**I/O model** — whether the underlying work is blocking (needs a thread) or
non-blocking (native coroutine). Statefulness is about **concurrency safety** —
whether multiple calls to the same generator instance can safely overlap. A
generator can be async but stateful (e.g., a cursor over an async database), or
sync but stateless (e.g., a random sampler).

Generators declare whether they are stateful via an `is_stateful` property on
the base class (default `False`). Stateful generators maintain internal state
across calls (e.g., `SeedDatasetColumnGenerator` has a DuckDB batch reader
cursor and leftover-row buffer). The scheduler **serializes tasks per-instance**
for stateful generators — row group N must complete before row group N+1 starts
for that generator. Stateless generators (e.g., `SamplerColumnGenerator`) can
dispatch all row groups concurrently.

This is a generator-level attribute, not a type-level assumption. Custom
generators declare their own contract.

The row group admission semaphore (`async_max_concurrent_row_groups`) and stateful
serialization are complementary, not conflicting: the semaphore controls how many row
groups are admitted into the scheduler at once; serialization controls the dispatch
order of seed tasks within the admitted set. A stateful generator with 3 row groups
admitted will still run their seeds in order (0 → 1 → 2); other columns in those row
groups remain free to pipeline.

### 6. Pre/post-batch processors

- **Pre-batch**: runs after seed generators complete for a row group, before
  other columns. Modeled as a barrier task for the row group. If a pre-batch
  processor fails, the entire row group is skipped.
- **Post-batch**: runs after all columns complete for a row group, before
  checkpoint write.

### 7. Retry & salvage policy

In deep pipelines, a transient failure on a late column drops the entire row,
wasting all upstream generation work. Controlled retry rounds recover rows that
would otherwise be lost.

1. **Classify failures**: transient (429, 500, timeout) → retryable; permanent
   (400, validation error, schema mismatch) → non-retryable (immediate drop).
2. **Deferred queue**: retryable failures are placed in a deferred queue with
   `attempt` count, `next_eligible_at` timestamp, and exponential backoff + jitter.
3. **Scheduling priority**: normal ready tasks are dispatched first. When the
   ready queue drains, the scheduler sweeps the deferred queue and re-dispatches
   all tasks whose backoff has elapsed — this is one salvage round. The scheduler
   runs at most `async_salvage_max_rounds` such rounds (default 2) before dropping
   all remaining deferred tasks. A task that keeps failing is retried once per round,
   so the maximum attempts per task is `async_salvage_max_rounds + 1`.
4. **Separate error threshold**: salvage rounds use their own error rate threshold
   (e.g., `async_salvage_error_threshold=0.8`), independent of the main scheduling
   loop, since higher failure rates are expected when retrying.
5. **Throttle-aware**: retries re-enter the throttle manager acquire path, so
   they don't exacerbate rate limiting.
6. **Final drop**: after retry budget is exhausted, mark the cell as failed and
   the row as dropped (via eager row-drop propagation). Continue row-group
   completion checks over remaining rows.

### 8. `allow_resize` scoping

The completion tracker uses row indices as stable identifiers. `allow_resize`
lets any generator change the row count mid-pipeline, which invalidates all
per-row completion state for downstream columns. Supporting this under parallel
execution would require dynamic rescheduling and row identity tracking.

**Async v1 scope**: if any column config has `allow_resize=True` and
`DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=1`, the builder raises a `DatasetGenerationError`
at startup (before any generation begins). The user must either remove
`allow_resize=True` from their config or disable the async engine. Silent
fallback is intentionally avoided — the user should know these two settings are
incompatible and make an explicit choice (see Follow-ups).

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All generators expose async-first `agenerate` (cell-by-cell) or async wrappers (full-column/from-scratch)
- [ ] Builder dispatches tasks based on dependency readiness, not column order
- [ ] Multiple columns execute in parallel when dependencies allow
- [ ] Row groups checkpoint to parquet upon full completion
- [ ] Existing sync path (`DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=0`) continues to work unchanged
- [ ] All existing tests pass; new tests cover dependency resolution and scheduling
- [ ] `make test-run-recipes` passes with async engine enabled

## Code Sketches

See [`code-sketches.md`](code-sketches.md) for structural sketches of the main
components and how they interact.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Execution Graph

Build a column-level static execution graph from column configs at builder init time.
The graph is column-granularity only — no cell-level nodes — so it stays small (O(C) nodes,
O(C²) edges worst-case) regardless of row count and avoids the barrier/checkpoint problems of a cell-level
graph.

- [x] `ExecutionGraph` class:
  - Backing stores: `dict[str, set[str]]` column → upstream columns;
    `dict[str, GenerationStrategy]` column → generation strategy
  - `get_upstream_columns(column: str) -> set[str]` — direct dependencies of a column
  - `get_downstream_columns(column: str) -> set[str]` — columns that depend on this one (for error attribution)
  - `get_strategy(column: str) -> GenerationStrategy` — cell-by-cell or full-column
  - `get_topological_order() -> list[str]` — valid DAG execution order (cached; used by scheduler and for validation)
  - `get_longest_dependency_chain() -> list[str]` — longest dependency chain by column count (useful for ETA estimates)
  - `get_root_columns() -> list[str]` — columns with no upstream deps, in topological order
  - `split_upstream_by_strategy(column: str) -> tuple[list[str], list[str]]` — splits
    upstream into (batch/full-column, cell-by-cell) groups; cached per column
  - `compute_task_count(num_records: int, buffer_size: int) -> dict[str, int]` — exact task count per
    column before the run starts; cell-by-cell columns produce `num_records` tasks,
    full-column columns (including from-scratch generators, which report `FULL_COLUMN`)
    produce `ceil(num_records / buffer_size)` tasks
  - `compute_cell_dependencies(column, row_group, row_index | None, row_group_size) -> list[SliceRef]`
    — derives cell-level deps on demand from column-level DAG + strategy
  - `to_mermaid() -> str` — Mermaid diagram string; nodes are annotated with strategy type
  - `columns` property — all column names in insertion order
  - `add_column(name, strategy)` / `add_edge(upstream, downstream)` — low-level construction
  - `set_side_effect(side_effect_col, producer)` / `resolve_side_effect(column) -> str` — side-effect mapping
- [x] `ExecutionGraph.create(column_configs, strategies)` classmethod factory:
  - Input: the ordered list of `ColumnConfigT` / `MultiColumnConfig`, plus a pre-computed
    strategy map (available from generators at builder init time via `get_generation_strategy()`)
  - For each config, read `config.required_columns` → set of upstream column names
  - Also register side-effect output columns (`__trace`, `__reasoning_content`, etc.)
    and map them back to their producer column, so downstream references resolve correctly
  - For `MultiColumnConfig`, all sub-columns share the same dependencies
  - Validate: every required column must resolve to a known producer (including
    registered side-effect outputs), and the graph must be acyclic (raises `DAGCircularDependencyError`)
- [x] Unit tests for graph construction, validation, longest chain, task count, cell deps, and Mermaid output

**Files**: new module `engine/dataset_builders/utils/execution_graph.py`, tests

### Step 2: Completion Tracker

A frontier-based tracker tracking which (column, row_group, row_index) tuples are
done and maintaining a ready-to-dispatch frontier. Row indices are **local** to their
row group (0-based within each group), matching the buffer manager's per-row-group addressing.

- [x] `CompletionTracker` class:
  - Internal: `dict[int, dict[str, set[int]]]` mapping row_group → column → set of completed local row indices
  - `with_graph(graph: ExecutionGraph, row_groups: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> CompletionTracker` —
    classmethod factory that creates a frontier-enabled tracker; seeds the frontier with root tasks
  - `mark_cell_complete(column, row_group, row_index)` — marks a cell done, discards it
    from the frontier, and calls `_enqueue_downstream` to add newly-ready tasks
  - `mark_row_range_complete(column, row_group, row_group_size)` — marks an entire batch done,
    validates row-group size consistency, and enqueues downstream
  - `is_complete(ref: SliceRef) -> bool` — check if a single cell is complete
  - `is_all_complete(cells: list[SliceRef]) -> bool` — check if all given cells/batches are complete
  - `drop_row(row_group, row_index)` — marks row as dropped; removes cell tasks for that row
    from the frontier; calls `_reevaluate_batch_tasks` since dropping a row may unblock
    full-column downstream tasks
  - `is_dropped(row_group, row_index) -> bool`
  - `is_row_group_complete(row_group, row_group_size, all_columns) -> bool` — all non-dropped rows have all columns done
  - `get_ready_tasks(dispatched: set[Task]) -> list[Task]` — returns all currently dispatchable
    tasks from the frontier, excluding already-dispatched/in-flight tasks; O(frontier) not O(C × R)
  - Internal frontier management:
    - `_seed_frontier()` — populates frontier with root column tasks (from `graph.get_root_columns()`)
    - `_enqueue_downstream(column, row_group, row_index | None)` — on completion, checks each
      downstream column's readiness using `split_upstream_by_strategy`; adds ready tasks to frontier
    - `_reevaluate_batch_tasks(row_group)` — after row drop, checks if any full-column tasks
      became ready (all non-dropped rows now complete)
  - Strategy validation: `mark_cell_complete` requires `CELL_BY_CELL`, `mark_row_range_complete`
    requires `FULL_COLUMN`; mismatches raise `ValueError`
- [x] No locks needed: all access is from the single asyncio event loop thread
- [x] Unit tests

**Files**: new module `engine/dataset_builders/utils/completion_tracker.py`, tests

### Step 3: Task Model

Simple dataclasses representing units of work and cell-level references.

- [x] `SliceRef` dataclass (frozen, ordered):
  - `column: str`, `row_group: int`, `row_index: int | None = None`
  - Reference to a cell or full row group in the execution grid
  - Used by `ExecutionGraph.compute_cell_dependencies()` and `CompletionTracker.is_complete()`
- [x] `Task` dataclass (frozen):
  - `column: str`
  - `row_group: int`
  - `row_index: int | None` (None for batch tasks)
  - `task_type: Literal["from_scratch", "cell", "batch", "pre_batch_processor", "post_batch_processor"]`
- [x] `TaskResult` dataclass:
  - `task: Task`, `status: Literal["success", "error"]`, `output: Any`, `error: Exception | None`
  - `retryable: bool = False` — whether the failure can be retried by the salvage loop
- [x] `TaskTrace` dataclass (only instantiated when tracing is enabled):
  - `column: str`, `row_group: int`, `row_index: int | None`, `task_type: str`
  - `dispatched_at: float` — `perf_counter()` when `create_task()` fires
  - `slot_acquired_at: float` — after execution semaphore acquired
  - `completed_at: float` — in `finally` block after generator returns
  - `status: str`, `error: str | None`
  - `from_task(task: Task) -> TaskTrace` classmethod factory
- [x] Hashable so we can track dispatched/pending sets
- [x] `DAGCircularDependencyError` in `errors.py` — raised by `ExecutionGraph.get_topological_order()`

**Files**: new module `engine/dataset_builders/utils/task_model.py` (+ `errors.py`) — must be its own
module since `CompletionTracker`, `AsyncTaskScheduler`, and the buffer manager all reference
`Task`/`TaskResult`/`SliceRef`; inlining would create import cycles.

### Step 4: Async Task Scheduler

The core orchestrator that replaces `_run_batch` for the async path.

- [x] `AsyncTaskScheduler` class:
  - Constructor takes: generators (by column name), `graph: ExecutionGraph`, row group
    definitions (`list[tuple[int, int]]`), concurrency limit (`async_scheduler_max_submitted_tasks`),
    row group semaphore (`async_max_concurrent_row_groups`), salvage config, error/result
    callbacks, `trace: bool = False`
  - Tracker is passed in externally (created via `CompletionTracker.with_graph(graph, row_groups)`)
  - Root task dispatch moved from tracker's `_seed_frontier` to scheduler's `_dispatch_seeds`
    (tracker frontier now starts empty; scheduler controls seed dispatch with stateful locks)
  - When `trace=True`, populates `scheduler.traces: list[TaskTrace]` (one record per task,
    created via `TaskTrace.from_task()`); otherwise no `TaskTrace` objects are created. See Profiling.
  - `async run()` — main loop:
    1. Acquire the row group semaphore (`async_max_concurrent_row_groups`) before
       admitting a new row group's seed tasks. Dispatch `from_scratch` tasks,
       respecting `is_stateful`: stateful generators serialize per-instance (row group
       N's seed completes before N+1's seed starts for that generator); stateless
       generators dispatch all admitted row groups concurrently
    2. Loop: pull from `tracker.get_ready_tasks(dispatched)` → dispatch each via
       `asyncio.create_task()` behind submission budget → on completion, call
       `tracker.mark_cell_complete()` or `tracker.mark_row_range_complete()` (the tracker's
       internal `_enqueue_downstream` auto-populates the frontier with newly-ready tasks)
       → repeat until all tasks done or early shutdown
    3. When ready queue drains, run salvage rounds over deferred retryable failures
       (up to `async_salvage_max_rounds` rounds); check `TaskResult.retryable` to classify
    4. After each row group completes (check via `tracker.is_row_group_complete()`):
       run post-batch processors, checkpoint
  - Task dispatch follows the pattern from §4: acquire execution slot → prepare →
    release → await throttle (LLM only) → reacquire → execute + writeback → release
  - Admission control: never allow more than `async_scheduler_max_submitted_tasks`
    tasks in submitted/running/waiting states; remove tasks from `dispatched` set on
    completion; hold remaining ready tasks in the scheduler queue until slots free up
  - Error handling: classify failures as retryable vs non-retryable (set `TaskResult.retryable`);
    retryable go to deferred queue with backoff; non-retryable trigger `tracker.drop_row()`
    which auto-removes cell tasks from frontier and re-evaluates batch readiness;
    same early-shutdown logic as `AsyncConcurrentExecutor` (error rate threshold within sliding window)
  - Progress tracking: create one `ProgressTracker` per column for accounting
    (success/failure counts, rate, ETA), but suppress per-completion interval logs
    in async mode. A separate background coroutine (`asyncio.create_task`) emits a
    single consolidated summary line every 10 seconds across all active columns;
    it is cancelled once all tasks complete. See UX Considerations.
- [x] Use `asyncio.Event` to wake the scheduler when a task completes (avoids polling).
  `Event` is sufficient — the scheduler resets it and re-checks `get_ready_tasks` on each wake;
  `Condition` would be needed only if waiting on a specific predicate, which the frontier
  already handles.
- [x] Unit tests with mock generators

**Files**: new module `engine/dataset_builders/async_scheduler.py`, tests

### Step 5: Generator Async Migration

Make all generator types async-capable and declare statefulness.

**Symmetric `generate` / `agenerate` contract**: only one of the two methods needs
to be implemented. The base class provides automatic bridging in both directions:
- If only `generate()` is implemented → `agenerate()` wraps it via `asyncio.to_thread`
  (already exists from PR #280).
- If only `agenerate()` is implemented → `generate()` uses a safe sync runner
  helper:
  - no running loop in current thread: use `asyncio.run(self.agenerate(data))`
  - running loop detected: submit to the builder's dedicated background event loop
    thread via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(...).result(timeout=...)`
  This avoids nested-loop errors while keeping async-first plugins ergonomic.

This means sync-first generators (most built-ins, existing plugins) work unchanged,
and async-first generators (new plugins doing native async I/O) only need to implement
`agenerate()` without writing a redundant sync version.

- [x] Add symmetric bridging on the base `ColumnGenerator`:
  - `agenerate()` default: `asyncio.to_thread(self.generate, data)` (already exists)
  - `generate()` default: call a safe sync runner helper that:
    - uses `asyncio.run()` if no loop is running in the current thread
    - otherwise submits to the background loop with `run_coroutine_threadsafe(...).result(timeout=...)`
  - Detect which one the subclass overrides to avoid infinite recursion
  - **Note**: v1 uses ThreadPoolExecutor fallback instead of builder's background loop (available in PR 4)
- [x] Add `is_stateful` property to base `ColumnGenerator` (default `False`).
  Stateful generators are serialized per-instance by the scheduler.
- [x] `ColumnGeneratorWithModelChatCompletion.agenerate` — already implemented (PR #280), no changes needed
- [x] `FromScratchColumnGenerator`: add both async wrappers — `async agenerate_from_scratch(num_records) -> DataFrame`
  (wraps `generate_from_scratch` in `asyncio.to_thread`) and `async agenerate(data: DataFrame) -> DataFrame`
  (wraps `generate` in `asyncio.to_thread` with defensive `df.copy()`). Both are needed because the
  scheduler dispatches subclasses via either path depending on whether the buffer is empty.
- [x] `ColumnGeneratorFullColumn`: add `async agenerate(data: DataFrame) -> DataFrame` — wraps sync in
  `asyncio.to_thread` with defensive `df.copy()` (see Risks). This intentionally overrides the base
  `ColumnGenerator.agenerate(dict)` with a DataFrame-typed signature; the scheduler dispatches the
  correct variant based on generation strategy.
- [x] `ExpressionColumnGenerator`: inherits full-column async wrapper
- [x] `SamplerColumnGenerator`: inherits both wrappers from `FromScratchColumnGenerator`; no custom implementation needed. `is_stateful = False`
- [x] `SeedDatasetColumnGenerator`: inherits both wrappers from `FromScratchColumnGenerator`; no custom implementation needed. `is_stateful = True` (maintains DuckDB batch reader cursor and leftover-row buffer)
- [x] `ValidationColumnGenerator`: inherits full-column async wrapper. Note: for `REMOTE` validators
  with `max_parallel_requests > 1`, `generate()` internally uses `ConcurrentThreadExecutor`, so the
  async wrapper spawns a thread that itself spawns more threads — bypassing the scheduler's concurrency
  controls for those HTTP calls. Acceptable for v1 (see Follow-ups).
- [x] `CustomColumnGenerator`: inherits directly from `ColumnGenerator` (not from
  `ColumnGeneratorFullColumn`), so it does not automatically inherit the full-column async wrapper. Needs its own
  `agenerate` that branches on strategy:
  - `CELL_BY_CELL`: if the user function is a coroutine (`asyncio.iscoroutinefunction`), call it directly;
    otherwise wrap in `asyncio.to_thread`
  - `FULL_COLUMN`: wrap `generate(DataFrame)` in `asyncio.to_thread` with defensive `df.copy()`
  `is_stateful` defaults to `False`; custom implementations can override it.
  - **Note**: uses `inspect.unwrap()` to detect async through the `@custom_column_generator` decorator wrapper
- [x] `ImageCellGenerator`, `EmbeddingCellGenerator`: add native `agenerate` using `model.agenerate_image` / `model.agenerate_text_embeddings`

**Files**: `generators/base.py`, `generators/expression.py`, `generators/samplers.py`, `generators/seed_dataset.py`, `generators/image.py`, `generators/embedding.py`, tests

### Step 6: Buffer / Row Group Manager

Adapt `DatasetBatchManager` for concurrent row group processing.

- [x] Support multiple row groups in-flight simultaneously (currently only one batch's buffer exists)
  - Option A: Multiple buffer instances (one per active row group)
  - Option B: Single shared buffer partitioned by row group offset ranges
  - Implemented: **Option A** — `RowGroupBufferManager` with per-row-group `list[dict]` buffers
- [x] `update_cell(row_group: int, row_index: int, column: str, value: Any)` — cell-level
  merge is the only write path for the async builder. Whole-record replacement
  (`update_record`) is unsafe under parallel execution (two independent columns
  finishing the same row concurrently would clobber each other's results)
  - Also: `update_cells` (multi-column) and `update_batch` (full column) convenience methods
- [x] `checkpoint_row_group(row_group: int)` — write parquet via `ArtifactStorage`, free memory
- [x] Preserve `drop_records` semantics within each row group — `drop_row` / `is_dropped` per row group
- [x] Keep backward compatibility with sync path (the existing `DatasetBatchManager` is untouched)

**Files**: new module `engine/dataset_builders/utils/row_group_buffer.py`, tests

### Step 7: Builder Integration

Wire the new scheduler into `ColumnWiseDatasetBuilder`.

- [ ] New method `_build_async(generators, num_records, buffer_size, ...)`:
  1. Build `ExecutionGraph.create(self._column_configs, strategies)` from configs and
     generator strategies; catch `DAGCircularDependencyError` and `ValueError` and
     re-raise as `DatasetGenerationError` with context
  2. Partition rows into row groups as `list[tuple[int, int]]` (rg_id, rg_size)
  3. Create `AsyncTaskScheduler` (which internally creates
     `CompletionTracker.with_graph(graph, row_groups)`)
  4. Run scheduler on the background event loop (reuse `_ensure_async_engine_loop()`
     from `dataset_builders/utils/async_concurrency.py` — already exists)
  5. Scheduler handles checkpointing via callbacks
- [ ] `build()` raises `DatasetGenerationError` at startup if `DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=1`
    and any column config has `allow_resize=True`, naming the offending column(s);
    otherwise dispatches to `_build_async()`
- [ ] `build_preview()` uses the same async path (single row group, no checkpoint)
- [ ] Error handling: `DatasetGenerationError` wrapping, record dropping, telemetry events
- [ ] Processor integration:
  - Pre-batch: scheduler runs after seed tasks for a row group
  - Post-batch: scheduler runs after all column tasks for a row group, before checkpoint

**Files**: `column_wise_builder.py`

### Step 8: Tests & Validation

Tests are added incrementally with each PR, not deferred to the end.

**PR 1 (foundation) — unit tests** (merged):
- [x] Execution graph construction, validation, `get_topological_order`, `get_longest_dependency_chain`
- [x] Execution graph: side-effect output columns resolve correctly (e.g., column

## PR Breakdown

The implementation steps map to 4 PRs that can be reviewed and merged independently.
Each PR is self-contained: it adds new modules with full test coverage but does not
change existing behavior until the final integration PR.

### PR 1: Foundation (Steps 1 + 2 + 3) — MERGED as [#356](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner/pull/356)

**Scope**: `ExecutionGraph`, `CompletionTracker`, `SliceRef`/`Task`/`TaskResult`/`TaskTrace`
dataclasses, `DAGCircularDependencyError`.

All three are pure data structures with no side effects on the existing codebase.
They live in new modules under `engine/dataset_builders/utils/` and are only imported
by code introduced in later PRs.

- `execution_graph.py` + tests
- `completion_tracker.py` + tests
- `task_model.py` + tests
- `errors.py` (`DAGCircularDependencyError`)

**Why grouped**: the three are tightly coupled (the tracker takes the graph to resolve
readiness, the task model is the unit of work for both), small individually, and
have no external dependencies. Splitting them into 3 separate PRs would create
review overhead without meaningful isolation benefit.

**What works after merge**: you can build an `ExecutionGraph.create()` from any existing config,
inspect it (`get_topological_order`, `get_longest_dependency_chain`, `compute_task_count`,
`to_mermaid`), query cell-level dependencies via `compute_cell_dependencies()`, and track
completion state with the frontier-enabled `CompletionTracker.with_graph()` — all in
isolation, with full test coverage. No runtime behavior changes.

**Can merge independently**: yes — no existing code imports these modules.

### PR 2: Generator async migration (Step 5)

**Scope**: `is_stateful` property on base class, symmetric `generate`/`agenerate`
bridging, async wrappers on all generator subclasses.

- Changes to `generators/base.py` (add `is_stateful`, symmetric bridging)
- Changes to `generators/samplers.py`, `generators/seed_dataset.py`,
  `generators/expression.py`, `generators/image.py`, `generators/embedding.py`
- `CustomColumnGenerator` async branching
- Tests for bridging, statefulness declaration, async wrappers

**What works after merge**: every generator can be called via `await agenerate()` or
`await agenerate_from_scratch()`. Sync generators auto-bridge to async via
`asyncio.to_thread`; async-first generators auto-bridge to sync via the safe runner
helper. `is_stateful` is queryable on every generator instance. The existing sync
path is completely untouched — `make test` passes with no behavior change.

**Can merge independently**: yes — `agenerate()` already exists on the base class
from PR #280; this PR extends the pattern to all subclasses and adds `is_stateful`.
Existing sync callers are unaffected.

**No dependency on PR 1**: generator changes don't reference the graph/tracker/task model.

### PR 3: Scheduler + buffer manager (Steps 4 + 6) - [PR #404](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner/pull/404)

**Scope**: `AsyncTaskScheduler`, `RowGroupBufferManager`.

- `async_scheduler.py` + tests (uses `ExecutionGraph`, `CompletionTracker`, `Task`, `TaskTrace` from PR 1)
- New `row_group_buffer.py` module (standalone, existing `DatasetBatchManager` untouched) + tests
- Retry/salvage logic, error handling
- `CompletionTracker._seed_frontier` simplified to no-op (root dispatch moved to scheduler)
- `CompletionTracker.get_ready_tasks` extended with `admitted_rgs` parameter

**Depends on**: PR 1 (imports `ExecutionGraph`, `CompletionTracker`, `Task`, `SliceRef`), PR 2
(calls `agenerate` / `agenerate_from_scratch`, reads `is_order_dependent`).

**Key integration with PR 1's frontier model**: The scheduler receives the tracker
externally (created via `CompletionTracker.with_graph(graph, row_groups)`). Root task
dispatch is handled by the scheduler's `_dispatch_seeds` (not the tracker's `_seed_frontier`).
The main loop pulls from `tracker.get_ready_tasks(dispatched, admitted_rgs)`, and on task
completion calls `mark_cell_complete()` / `mark_row_range_complete()` which internally
enqueues newly-ready downstream tasks. On row drop, calls `tracker.drop_row()` which
removes frontier tasks and re-evaluates batch readiness.

**What works after merge**: the scheduler can be instantiated with mock generators and
driven through its full lifecycle in tests - row group admission, dependency-driven
dispatch, retry/salvage, row drops, checkpoint callbacks. The buffer manager supports
concurrent row groups with cell-level writes. Not yet wired into the real builder.

**Deferred to PR 4**: progress tracking/consolidation, error rate shutdown with sliding
window, retryable-success tests, eager row-drop propagation tests.

**Can merge independently**: yes - the scheduler is a new module, not yet wired into
the builder. The buffer manager is a new standalone module.

### PR 4: Builder integration (Steps 7 + 8)

**Scope**: Wire everything together in `ColumnWiseDatasetBuilder`.

- `_build_async()` method on `ColumnWiseDatasetBuilder`
- `allow_resize` startup check
- Pre/post-batch processor integration
- Integration tests, recipe tests with `DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=1`
- Benchmark setup

**Depends on**: PRs 1, 2, 3.

**What works after merge**: `DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=1` enables the full async
pipeline end-to-end. Multi-column configs run with dependency-aware parallel
scheduling, row group checkpointing, retry/salvage, and progress reporting. The
sync path (`DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=0`, the default) is unchanged.

**This is the only PR that changes existing behavior** (gated behind
`DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=1`).

## Risks & Considerations

- **Memory with concurrent row groups**: Having multiple row groups in-flight increases
  peak memory. Mitigation: a dedicated semaphore caps concurrent in-flight row groups,
  controlled by `async_max_concurrent_row_groups` (default 3). The scheduler only admits
  a new row group's seed tasks once a slot is available.

- **Unbounded parked coroutines during throttle waits**: Releasing execution slots
  before throttle acquire improves fairness, but can create large numbers of parked
  tasks if admission is not bounded. Mitigation: enforce
  `async_scheduler_max_submitted_tasks` as a hard cap on submitted/running/waiting
  tasks.

- **Eager row-drop propagation**: When a task fails non-recoverably (non-retryable,
  or retry budget exhausted), the **entire row** must be marked as dropped across all
  columns — not just the failed column. Otherwise, independent columns that don't
  depend on the failed column will continue processing that row, wasting compute on
  a row that can never be complete. The completion tracker needs a `drop_row(row_group,
  row_index)` method that skips all pending tasks for that row; in-flight tasks may
  still complete but their writeback is suppressed once the row is marked dropped.
  Retryable failures go to the deferred queue first; eager drop only happens after
  retries are exhausted. Row group is complete when all non-dropped rows have all
  columns done.

- **Dropped rows vs in-flight batch/full-column work (v1 policy)**: preemptively
  cancelling already-running full-column/batch tasks is complex and error-prone.
  Async v1 keeps this simple: once a row is dropped, scheduler will not enqueue new
  tasks for that row and all write paths must suppress writeback for dropped rows.
  Already-running batch/full-column tasks may still compute values for dropped rows,
  but those outputs are ignored. Dropped-row propagation is strictly row-scoped;
  a row-group/batch is never dropped solely due to row-level failures.

- **Sync bridge in async-hosted contexts**: async-first generators need a safe
  `generate()` fallback that works even when called from environments with an active
  event loop (notebooks/services). Mitigation: use a sync runner helper that uses
  `asyncio.run()` when safe, else routes through the dedicated background event loop
  via `run_coroutine_threadsafe(...).result(timeout=...)`.

- **Full-column generator ordering**: If two full-column generators have no mutual
  dependency, they could run in parallel on the same row group. This is safe as long
  as they operate on independent columns. `asyncio.to_thread` passes **object
  references**, not copies — if two full-column generators share the same DataFrame,
  concurrent mutation is possible. Solution: pass `df.copy()` to each full-column
  generator dispatched to a thread, and merge results back by column name.

- **Pre-batch processors mutating data**: Pre-batch processors (e.g., schema transform)
  can add/remove/modify rows. This changes the row count and invalidates the completion
  tracker's row indices. Solution: treat pre-batch as a barrier that resets the tracker
  state for that row group (re-index rows after processor runs). If a pre-batch
  processor **fails**, the entire row group is skipped (treated as a fatal row-group
  error — log, skip, continue with remaining row groups).

- **Undersized last row group**: If `num_records` is not a multiple of `buffer_size`,
  the last row group has fewer rows. This is the same as the sync path and should not
  require special handling, but full-column generators and batch-level logic must not
  assume uniform row group sizes.

- **`allow_resize` incompatibility**: Any generator with `allow_resize=True` can change
  the row count mid-pipeline, invalidating per-row completion state for all downstream
  columns. Dynamic rescheduling and row identity tracking would be needed to support
  this. **Async v1 raises a `DatasetGenerationError` at startup** when any config uses
  `allow_resize=True` with the async engine enabled, naming the offending column(s).
  The user must resolve the conflict explicitly.

- **Backward compatibility**: The sync path must remain untouched. All new code is
  gated behind `DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=1` and sits in new modules.

- **Thread pool sizing**: sync generators wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` use Python's
  default thread pool executor (`min(32, cpu_count + 4)`). For v1, keep the default —
  the execution semaphore and row group cap already bound actual concurrency to levels
  where the default pool is unlikely to be a bottleneck (see Follow-ups).

- **Silent task hangs**: a sync generator wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` could hang
  indefinitely. For v1, rely on upstream model timeouts (see Follow-ups).

- **Compute-bound generators starving I/O-bound tasks**: compute-bound and I/O-bound
  tasks share the same thread pool (via `asyncio.to_thread`). If compute-heavy tasks
  saturate the pool, I/O-bound tasks (LLM calls, remote validators) can't acquire
  threads and stall — even though they'd release the GIL immediately on network I/O.
  Additionally, the GIL serializes CPU-bound threads, so compute tasks get threading
  overhead with no parallelism. Native async generators that do CPU work without
  yielding are worse — they block the event loop thread entirely, freezing all
  scheduling. Built-in compute-bound generators (expression eval, samplers) are
  microsecond-fast, so this risk is limited to custom generators doing heavy CPU work.
  For v1, `asyncio.to_thread` is sufficient; a future `is_cpu_bound` property could
  route compute-heavy generators to a separate `ProcessPoolExecutor`, keeping the
  thread pool available for I/O-bound work (see Follow-ups).

## UX Considerations

- **Interleaved log output**: with parallel columns and row groups, log lines will interleave.
  All async log output should include `(column=X, row_group=N)` context so output remains
  readable during debugging.

- **Progress display**: in the async path, per-column `ProgressTracker` interval logs are
  suppressed to avoid interleaved noise. Instead, the scheduler runs a lightweight background
  coroutine (`asyncio.create_task`) that emits a single consolidated summary line on a fixed
  timer (e.g., every 10 seconds):
  ```
  Progress: col_A 45/100 (45%, 2.1 rec/s) | col_B 32/100 (32%) | col_C 78/100 (78%, eta 12s)
  ```
  The coroutine reads completion counters from existing `ProgressTracker` instances and is
  cancelled once all tasks are done. The sync path is unchanged.

- **Peak memory**: multiple in-flight row groups increase peak memory. The cap is
  `async_max_concurrent_row_groups` (default 3), exposed so users can lower it in
  memory-constrained environments.

- **New config knobs**: `async_scheduler_max_submitted_tasks`, `async_max_concurrent_row_groups`,
  `async_salvage_max_rounds`, and `async_salvage_error_threshold` are new parameters users may
  encounter in error messages or docs. Each must have a sensible default; users should not need
  to tune them in the common case.

- **Async custom columns**: users can now write `async def` functions with
  `@custom_column_generator` and get native async execution without thread overhead. Worth
  surfacing in the changelog and docs.

- **Plugin async upgrade path**: plugin authors who want native async performance can
  override `agenerate()` instead of `generate()` — the symmetric bridging means they don't
  need to implement both. Stateful plugins should override `is_stateful = True`. Worth
  documenting in the plugin authoring guide.

### What stays the same

- **Config API**: no schema changes — existing configs work without modification.
- **Sync path**: `DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=0` (the default) is untouched; existing users
  see no behavioral change.
- **Existing plugins and sync custom columns**: all continue to work unchanged.
- **Row ordering**: the final dataset rows are always in the declared order regardless of
  out-of-order row group completion.
- **Checkpoint file naming and format**: parquet files use the same naming scheme and schema.

## Profiling

Task execution tracing is opt-in, enabled by passing `trace=True` to `build()` or setting
`DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_TRACE=1`. When disabled (the default), no `TaskTrace` objects are
created and there is no overhead. When enabled, the scheduler collects one `TaskTrace`
record per task and exposes the list as `scheduler.traces: list[TaskTrace]`, which is
surfaced on the result object after the run.

### Instrumentation points

Three timestamps are recorded inside the task coroutine — all on the event loop thread,
so no locking is needed:

1. `dispatched_at` — set in the scheduler loop right before `asyncio.create_task()`
2. `slot_acquired_at` — set inside the coroutine immediately after `await semaphore.acquire()`
3. `completed_at` + `status` — set in a `try/finally` block wrapping the generator call

The `TaskTrace` object is created at dispatch time and passed into the coroutine closure;
the coroutine mutates it in-place. On completion it is appended to `scheduler.traces` via
the result callback.

### What the data shows

- `slot_acquired_at - dispatched_at`: time waiting on the execution semaphore (contention indicator)
- `completed_at - slot_acquired_at`: actual generator execution time
- Dispatch timestamps across tasks: verify dependency order and parallelism (e.g. two
  independent columns should show overlapping `slot_acquired_at`–`completed_at` ranges)

### Example output

Two-column config (`topic` → `question` → `answer`), 2 row groups, 3 rows each:

```
column    rg  row  type          dispatched  slot_acquired  completed  duration  status
--------  --  ---  ------------  ----------  -------------  ---------  --------  ------
topic      0   -   from_scratch   0.000       0.001          0.012      0.011    ok
topic      1   -   from_scratch   0.001       0.001          0.013      0.012    ok     ← RG0+1 overlap (stateless)

...
```

`topic` RG0 and RG1 dispatch 1ms apart and run concurrently (stateless). `question` rows
are all dispatched the moment `topic` completes for their row group. `answer[0,0]` is
dispatched at `t=0.143`, exactly when `question[0,0]` finishes — confirming cell-level
pipelining across row groups.

### Usage

```python
result = data_designer.build(num_records=100, trace=True)
df = pd.DataFrame([asdict(t) for t in result.traces])
df["wait"] = df["slot_acquired_at"] - df["dispatched_at"]
df["duration"] = df["completed_at"] - df["slot_acquired_at"]
df.groupby("column")[["wait", "duration"]].describe()
```

## Relation to PR #269

PR #269 ("feat: add execution graph builder plan with reference implementation") is a
companion design by @johnnygreco that we reviewed before finalising this plan. It proposes
a static `ExecutionGraph` with typed node IDs (`CellNodeId`, `BarrierNodeId`), an
`ExecutionTraits` flag enum, and a `CompletionTracker`. It intentionally stops at the
graph/tracker layer; this plan covers the full stack from graph through to deployment.

### What we adopted

- **Static `ExecutionGraph`**: we adopt the concept of building a static graph upfront,
  inspectable before and after a run. Our graph is column-granularity rather than
  cell-granularity — see below for why.
- **Dependency source**: derive the graph from `required_columns` on existing configs,
  extended with a side-effect mapping for columns like `summary__trace`. No config schema
  changes in either approach.
- **Trait inference from properties, not class names**: `GraphBuilder._infer_traits()`
  inspects `can_generate_from_scratch` and `get_generation_strategy()` rather than
  matching class names. We apply the same principle, keeping plugin generators compatible.
- **Lightweight completion tracking**: a `dict[str, set[int]]` mapping column → completed
  rows, rather than materialising O(C × R) cell-level state. Our `CompletionTracker`
  follows the same design.
- **Statefulness as a separate concern from execution strategy**: PR #269 separates
  execution traits (how a generator runs) from per-instance concurrency safety. We
  formalise this with the `is_stateful` property.

### What we changed, and why

**Column-level graph, not cell-level.** PR #269 models every `(row, column)` pair
as a virtual `CellNodeId`. Full-column generators become `BARRIER` nodes — a synthetic
node that must complete before any output cells are ready. This faithfully models
dependencies but creates a problem the PR itself flags as an open issue: a validation
column anywhere in the pipeline blocks all checkpointing until the entire dataset
completes, because no row is "done" until every column, including the barrier, finishes.
Cell-level nodes also scale to O(C × R), which is large for realistic dataset sizes.

We use a **column-level** `ExecutionGraph` instead — O(C) nodes, O(C²) edges worst-case,
fixed size regardless of row count. This still provides the full value of a static graph (visualization,
critical path, upfront task counts, error attribution via `downstream()`) without the
checkpoint problem or the node explosion. Full-column tasks are scoped to a **row group**:
the effective barrier is just that FULL_COLUMN task waiting for all rows *in that group*,
not the whole dataset. Checkpoints happen as each row group completes, so a failure
mid-run loses at most one batch.

**`ExecutionTraits` replaced by `GenerationStrategy` on the graph.** PR #269 attaches an
`ExecutionTraits` flag enum (`CELL`, `BARRIER`, `ROW_STREAMABLE`) to each node. Since our
graph is column-level, we store `GenerationStrategy` (cell-by-cell, full-column) directly
on each column node instead (accessible via `get_strategy()`). From-scratch columns are
identified by having no upstream dependencies in the graph (via `get_root_columns()`); the
scheduler checks `can_generate_from_scratch` on the generator instance to determine which
method to call. The `split_upstream_by_strategy()` method provides cached separation of
upstream deps by strategy type, used by the tracker's frontier logic. This serves the same
purpose as `ExecutionTraits` — the scheduler and `CompletionTracker` use it to determine
task granularity — without needing typed node IDs or flag combinations.

**`ROW_STREAMABLE` trait omitted.** PR #269 introduces `is_row_streamable` so full-column
generators that process rows independently (e.g., `ExpressionColumnGenerator`) can be
scheduled row-by-row, recovering some pipelining within a barrier. In our row-group model
this is unnecessary: even a full-column generator only blocks one batch, preserving
checkpoint cadence without subdividing tasks further. Expression columns run in
microseconds and are never the scheduling bottleneck. We note this as a potential
follow-up if profiling shows otherwise.

**Scheduler and concurrency layers added.** PR #269 deliberately stops at the graph and
tracker. Steps 1–3 of this plan (execution graph, completion tracker, task model) are
directly informed by PR #269 and we treat it as the reference design for that layer. The
remaining steps — scheduler, concurrency controls, retry/salvage, buffer manager, and
builder integration — extend that foundation to a deployable implementation.

## Notes

### Out of scope for this PR
- Overhauling `ModelFacade` internals (PR #344's scope)
- Building a cell-level static execution graph (PR #269's `CellNodeId`/`BarrierNodeId`
  approach — we use a column-level graph instead, which avoids the barrier/checkpoint problem)
- Removing the sync/threaded path (it stays as the default)

### Follow-ups
- **`allow_resize` async support**: currently raises at startup when the async engine is
  enabled; full support requires dynamic rescheduling and row identity tracking.
- **Native async `RemoteValidator`**: `ValidationColumnGenerator` wraps `generate()` in
  `asyncio.to_thread`, which spawns a thread that itself uses `ConcurrentThreadExecutor`
  for parallel HTTP calls, bypassing the scheduler's concurrency controls. Fix: native
  async `agenerate` on `RemoteValidator`.
- **Per-generator task timeouts**: sync generators wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` can
  hang indefinitely. For v1 we rely on upstream model timeouts; optional per-generator
  timeout overrides are the follow-up.
- **Wasted-work telemetry**: in-flight full-column/batch tasks continue computing after
  a row is dropped; add telemetry to track compute wasted on dropped rows.
- **Thread pool sizing**: if profiling shows saturation of the default executor
  (`min(32, cpu_count + 4)`), explicitly size it to match the scheduler caps.
- **`ProcessPoolExecutor` for compute-bound generators**: if custom generators doing
  heavy CPU work cause GIL contention, add an `is_cpu_bound` property and route those
  generators to a `ProcessPoolExecutor` for true parallelism.

### Impact on plugins and custom columns

This change is **backward-compatible** with all existing plugins and custom columns.
No plugin author needs to modify their code for it to work under the async scheduler.

**Column generator plugins** (registered via entry points): plugins subclass one of
the base generator classes and implement `generate()`. The base class `agenerate()`
fallback wraps `generate()` in `asyncio.to_thread`, so every existing plugin
automatically gets async support. Plugins that want native async performance can
optionally override `agenerate()` instead — the symmetric bridging means they don't
need to implement `generate()` at all. The `is_stateful` property defaults to `False`,
which is correct for most plugins; stateful plugins can override it.
**Important**: only override `agenerate()` if your work is I/O-bound (network calls,
async database queries). Compute-bound plugins should implement `generate()` and let
the framework wrap it in `asyncio.to_thread` — this keeps CPU work off the event loop
thread. An `agenerate()` that does CPU work without yielding blocks the event loop
and freezes all scheduling.

**Custom columns** (`@custom_column_generator`): user-provided sync functions are
wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` by the framework. If the user provides an async
function, `CustomColumnGenerator` detects this via `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction`
and calls it directly as a coroutine — no thread pool overhead.
The same rule applies: only use `async def` for I/O-bound work. A compute-bound
`async def` that never awaits will block the event loop. For data transformations,
string processing, or any CPU-heavy logic, use a regular `def`.

**Processor plugins** (`process_before_batch`, `process_after_batch`,
`process_after_generation`): processors run at barrier points in the scheduling loop
where no column generation is concurrent. They remain purely synchronous and are
unaffected by this change.

### Key insight from existing code
Every column config already has a `required_columns` property that returns the
column names referenced in its Jinja2 templates. This gives us explicit dependency
information without any config schema changes. The `ExecutionGraph` dependency
structure starts as `{col.name: set(col.required_columns) for col in configs}`,
extended with a side-effect output mapping so that references to columns like
`summary__trace` resolve to a dependency on the `summary` generator.

### On static graph vs dynamic scheduling
The `ExecutionGraph` is a static column-level DAG built once at init time — it
describes *what* can run and in what order. Scheduling remains dynamic: the
completion tracker drives readiness checks as tasks complete, and new tasks become
eligible without any upfront planning. The two concerns are complementary:
the graph provides inspectability and upfront analysis; the tracker provides
runtime readiness at row granularity.
